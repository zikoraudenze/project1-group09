## FSF-PT-DECEMBER-120224 Bootcamp: Project 1, Group 09

## Projeft Title: Activity Tracker

Group Members: Brett McBryde, Javier Bujan, Evan Rees, Kingsley Udenze


## Introduction

The day-to-day weather has a massive impact on the activities we hope to accomplish during the day.

Our app is primarily an activity tracker that also displays accurate and up-to-date weather information will allow users to be able to have a central place to plan their days accordingly. 


## Process

We began the process by ideating and brainstorming based on a few criteria: a. the timeline for this project being two weeks, our team needed to determine what would be within the scope of our skills and abilities to complete within the time period, b. what are key user needs that we can build upon without doing primary research/talking to users. 

Based on these criteria, our group's project sought to address a common issue many people face on a daily basis: structuring their day and schedule by organizing their tasks and planning for the weather. 

The nature of this course is incredibly fast-paced and demanding, and as part-time students, many of whom are also working full or part time jobs while taking this course, our schedules are full, and it is imperative to be organized in order to stay on top of course content and life responsibilities. While many of us are located in a variety of geographical areas, weather conditions differ greatly. 

Our group then created a basic wireframe using Microsoft Paint to create an initial layout of the elements we hoped to include. We settled on 4 key elements: 
    
    - an interactive calendar element for users to browse through and select dates
    - a summary section displaying the details of an Activity entered by a user (date, time, location, activity name, and activity description)
    - a list section depicting all Activities entered by the user, displaying the     title and the location of the Activity
    - an animated depiction of the current weather for the location and time and date for the activity chosen/the current date

Based on these elements and the wireframe, our team got to work using VS Code, GitLab, and GitHub to create and iterate on code. After building out the basic foundation using HTML, we used the CDN CSS Stylesheet from Bootstrap to add style elements and colour to the necessary sections. 

Our app consists of 3 separate JS files in order to allow us as coders to not be stepping on each others' toes and overwriting each others' code, and to allow us to work on different elements at the same time, Our primary methods of communication were Slack and Discord. 

## User Stories

User Story 1: As a part-time student and working full-time, I want the ability to view up-to-date weather data easily so that I can plan my busy schedule according to the weather and have a place to plan my activities.

User Story 2: As a resident of a city that has extremely cold climate in winter, I want an activity tracker that is easily accessible and provides daily and weekly weather updates, so that I can maintain motivation during reduced daylight hours and cold spells.

User Story 3: As an employee that commutes to an in-person, demanding job, I want to be able to plan out my route and time for commuting for the day based on the weather, so that I can arrive and leave work on time and be productive.

## Acceptance Criteria

Based on the user stories created and the elements our team ideated in the wireframes, we created a series of Acceptance Criteria in order to establish the elements we hoped to include in the MVP so as to know when it has been completed:

- It is done when a user is able to select "Add Activity" and enter their name, the date, time, and location of the activity with a short description
- It is done when the information a user has entered for an Activity is stored in Local Storage
- It is done when a user is able to navigate through and interact with the calendar element and view the corresponding Activities displayed in the Activity Summary section
- It is done when the weather area displays animated graphics of the corresponding weather conditions for the Activities selected
